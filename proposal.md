#BEEP

##Summary
A playbook for mental health. Users can log their moods at regular intervals using text, phone, or web interfaces. They can see a summary of their moods over a given period of time. The user can choose to receive a phone call at a specified time every day where they can answer a short series of questions. (i.e. On a scale of 1 to 10: how have you been feeling today as a whole? How bad has your anxiety been? How bad has your depression been? Have you had any thoughts of self-harm?), receive questions and respond via text, or login to the app and submit responses. A user can share this information with a psychiatrist/psychologist.
